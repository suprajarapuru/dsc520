## Load the readxl package
library(readxl)

## Load the plyr package
library(plyr)

## Set the working directory to the root of your DSC 520 directory
setwd("/Users/Supraja/dsc520")

## Load the `data/week-6-housing.xlsx` to
housing_df <- read_excel("data/week-6-housing.xlsx")
head(housing_df)
str(housing_df)

#1.Use the apply function on a variable in your dataset

#get sum of the sale price using apply function
apply(housing_df[,2],MARGIN=2,FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)

# 2.Use the aggregate function on a variable in your dataset

#get mean sales price by cityname using aggregate function
colnames(housing_df)[1] <- "Sale_Date"
colnames(housing_df)[2] <- "Sale_Price"
aggregate(Sale_Price ~ ctyname, housing_df, mean)


# 3.Use the plyr function on a variable in your
# dataset â€“ more specifically, I want to see you split some data,
# perform a modification to the data, and then bring it back together

ddply(housing_df, .(bedrooms), function(x) sum(x$Sale_Price))

# 4.Check distributions of the data
summary(housing_df)

#Sale_Price vary between 698 to 4400000. The mean Sale_Price is 660738.
#Bedrooms vary between 0 to 11. There are so many variants available.
#year_built vary from 1900 to 2016. Some houses are very old available for sale.
#sq_ft_lot vary between 785 to 1631322.
#sale_Date vary between 2006-01-03 to 2016-12-16.
